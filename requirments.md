## Vision

**Minimum Length: 3-5 sentences**

## What is the vision of this product?

The goal of our project is to have an interactive clue based murder mystery game, We are seeking to have an interactive experience that allows for us to be able and allow for multiple rooms and have different characters that can change in each rooms and allow for the user to select what character they want to play as.

## What pain point does this project solve?

An interactive experience for thinking and entertainment. With a fun aspect of crazy off the wall ideas for murder weapons and ways of death. Without having a complete over stimulating experience.

## Why should we care about your product?

The interactive experience that will allow for people to be able to use problem solving skills, get a laugh and allow for multiple times of play and not experience similar situations. The product will allow for an interactive experience that also provide a user the chance to utilize untypically deductive skills and integrates problem solving as well.

## Scope (In/Out)

- IN - What will your product do
  - Describe the individual features that your product will do.
    Multiple rooms, multiple characters, and multiple murder weapons
  - High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
    - Multiple rooms- Currently 2 but stretching for a total of Four based on functionality of JavaScript and the working time restrictions.
    - Multiple characters- Currently at 10 but will hopefully have time to build out a total of 20 that will allow for a more dynamic and interactive experience.
    - Multiple weapons- List of many weapons that will allow for a wide range of scenarios that will get the most user friendly experience.
    - Multiple room- variety of rooms with different backgrounds and themes to support the weapons and allow for the most interactive experience possible.

- Example:
    - The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafe’s in the area
    - The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations
    - Users will be able to “Star” their favorite shops.
    - Each shop will contain reviews of the customer’s experiences
- OUT - What will your product not do.
- These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

- We have no plans to turn this into a featured app on any platform and this is utilized for the sole purpose of enjoyment and entertainment. We will avoid exposure to a younger audience due to the graphic nature and content of the application, with the current state of the mental health system we have zero intentions of being a negative exposure to anyone who is not capable of handling the content they be exposed too. 

- Minimum Viable Product vs

What will your MVP functionality be?

- What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? Have a minimum of 2 rooms to allow for multiple users to be able to have an interactive experience and get a new story from them. With four clue cards and a backstory to each room.

What are your stretch goals?

- To have a fully functional and working application by mid day Wednesday, to allow for further implementation of more room that will allow for a more dynamic environment.

**Stretch**

What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

- To have four rooms with 20 players. 

## Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

1. An admin can create and delete user accounts
Hayden Cooper will be the admin and review the pull request for the team. With review by all team members as well. 

The task will be separated and will be divided into manageable things based on the teams ability both strength and weaknesses. This will allow for maximum learning and teachings to help with the adult learning method. 

2. A user can update their profile information
3. A user can search all of the products in the inventory

**Data Flow**

Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

The user will be greeted with a welcome screen to review the purpose and background of the application. Then will be able to choose a character then can move to a room the choosing followed by the back story to that room. Then will be able to answer questions and get clue cards the goal is to determine hwo the victim died and what weapon was used as well the person who did it based off the characters inside of the room.
