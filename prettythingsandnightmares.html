            As you approach the porcelain doll room, a sense of unease washes over you. You can't quite explain why, but
            something about the room seems off. You cautiously push open the door and step inside, and are immediately
            greeted by a scene straight out of a horror movie. The room is filled with porcelain dolls, arranged in
            eerie poses that seem almost too lifelike. As you move deeper into the room, you can't help but feel as
            though the dolls are watching you, their unblinking eyes following your every move. You shiver
            involuntarily, unsure if you're ready to explore this unsettling place. As you approach the porcelain doll
